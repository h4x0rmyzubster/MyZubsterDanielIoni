- ✅ **Automatic Monero payments** with escrow
- ✅ **Self-hosted option** for developers
- ✅ **Official hosted service** at [https://myzubster.com](https://myzubster.com)

## 🚀 What is MyZubster?

MyZubster is a hyperlocal skill-sharing platform. It lets people in the same neighborhood offer services, request help, chat, book appointments, and send quotes — all in a community-driven environment.

**The goal** is to empower communities to collaborate directly, bypassing centralized platforms and building local connections.

---

## 💰 Platform Fee

MyZubster applies a **2% platform fee** on all transactions to support:

- 🖥️ **Infrastructure costs** (servers, databases, monitoring)
- 👨‍💻 **Development & maintenance**
- 🛡️ **Security & escrow services**
- 📱 **Mobile app updates**

The fee is **automatically applied** via smart contract and cannot be removed on the official SaaS platform.

**Fee Wallet:** Maintained by Daniel Ioni (DanielIoni-creator)

For self-hosted versions, the fee can be modified or removed.

---

## 🛠️ SaaS vs Self-Hosted

| Feature | SaaS (Official) | Self-Hosted |
|---------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Fee** | 2% (automatic) | Configurable |
| **Updates** | Automatic | Manual |
| **Support** | Priority | Community |
| **Escrow** | ✅ Included | Optional |
| **Monitoring** | 24/7 | Self-managed |
| **Cost** | Free (fee-based) | Infrastructure cost |

**Choose SaaS for:** Quick start, no maintenance, automatic updates, priority support.

**Choose Self-Hosted for:** Full control, custom modifications, privacy, learning.

## 💳 Monero Integration

MyZubster uses **Monero (XMR)** for private, secure payments:

- 🔒 **Privacy-first**: No transaction tracking
- 💰 **2% Platform Fee**: Auto-deducted for sustainability
- 🛡️ **Escrow Protection**: Funds locked until work is confirmed
- ⚡ **Instant Payments**: Fast confirmation with 10+ confirmations
- 🌍 **Global**: Send/receive XMR anywhere

### How it works

1. Client sends XMR to escrow address
2. 2% fee is deducted automatically
3. Funds are held in escrow until work is completed
4. Professional receives payment (minus 2% fee)
5. Fee goes to platform wallet (Daniel Ioni)

### Test Mode

For testing without real Monero, use simulation mode:
```bash
MONERO_PAYMENT_SIMULATION_MS=5000 npm start
